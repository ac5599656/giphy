## Summary

Emotional Gif app allows users to search gif based on emotion.  
Users can input the perferable emotional gif.  Once the users click 
the search button, the landing page disappears and the gifs for that 
particular emotion of the search appear.  

## More Description
The problem with the app was to make the gifs appear in an orderly fashion way. 
To do this I implemeneted the grid css.  In the for loop, I assign variables to the 
column and content.  Then later I append  each of the contents of the gifs to the column.
